This node implements the client for the action server bug_as.py. This module asks the user for a couple of goal cordinates and send the request to the action server.
The user can also cancel the goal and insert a new one.

Subscriber:
    /odom: The position and velocity of the robot.

Publisher:
    /custom_vel: The velocity of the robot, uses the custom message Cstm_vel.
